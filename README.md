# UNIX-Socket-Challenge-Response
This code is an implementation of client side for the following challenge response protocol.

![alt text](https://github.com/amshusky18/UNIX-Socket-Challenge-Response/blob/master/server.JPG)

The server accepts only one particular input/message which when hashed using md5 will contain first 3 bytes or 6 characters as "0" (zeros). 

The code performs a bruteforce attack to find such particular string.
